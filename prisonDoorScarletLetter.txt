<1>
A throng of bearded men in sadcolored garments
and gray
<2>
[steeple crowned] hats intermixed with women some
wearing hoods and
<3>
others [bare headed] was assembled in front of a
wooden edifice the
<4>
door of which was heavily timbered with oak
and studded with [iron spikes](metal)
<5>
The founders of a new colony whatever Utopia
of [human virtue] and
<6>
happiness they might originally project have
invariably recognized it
<7>
among their [earliest practical necessities]
to allot a portion of the
<8>
virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion
as the site of a
<9>
prison In accordance with this rule it may
safely be assumed that
<10>
the forefathers of Boston had built the first
prisonhouse somewhere
<11>
in the vicinity of [Corn hill] almost as
seasonably
as they marked out
<20>
the first [burial ground] on
[Isaac Johnson's](people)
lot and round about his
<19>
grave(places) which subsequently became the
nucleus of
all the congregated
<18>
sepulchres(places) in the old churchyard(places)
of
[Kings Chapel](places)
Certain it is
<17>
that some fifteen or twenty years after the
settlement of the town
<16>
the [wooden jail](places) was already marked
with
weatherstains and other
<15>
indications of age which gave a yet
darker(adjectives)
aspect to its
<14>
beetlebrowed and gloomy(adjectives) front The
rust on the
ponderous ironwork of
<13>
its oaken(adjectives) door looked more
antique(adjectives) than anything
else in the New
<12>
World(places) Like all that pertains to crime
it seemed
never to have known
<11>
a youthful era Before this ugly(adjectives)
edifice and
between it and the
<10>
wheeltrack of the street was a grassplot much
overgrown with
<9>
burdock [pig weed] appleperu and such unsightly
vegetation which
<8>
evidently found something congenial(adjectives)
in the soil
that had so early
<7>
borne the black flower of civilized society a
prison But on one side
<6>
of the portal and rooted almost at the
threshold was a wild
<5>
rosebush covered in this month of June with its
delicate gems
<4>
which might be imagined to offer their fragrance
and fragile beauty to
<3>
the prisoner as he went in and to the condemned
criminal as he came
<2>
forth to his doom in token that the deep heart
of Nature could pity
<1>
and be kind(adjectives) to him
<57>
This rosebush by a strange(adjectives) chance
has been kept
alive in history
<180>
but whether it had merely survived out of the
stern old wilderness(places) so
<98713>
long after the fall of the gigantic(adjectives)
pines and
oaks that originally
<874>
overshadowed it or whether as there is fair
authority for
<392>
believing it had sprung up under the footsteps
of the sainted Ann
<873>
Hutchinson as she entered the [prison door] we
shall not take upon us
<819>
to determine Finding it so directly on the
threshold of our
<832>
narrative which is now about to issue from that
inauspicious(adjectives) portal
<1897>
we could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of
its flowers and
<9318>
present it to the reader It may serve let us hope
to symbolize some
<89273>
sweet(adjectives) moral blossom that may be found along the
track or relieve the
<89742>
darkening close of a tale of human frailty and
sorrow
<2>
Illustration
<300>
The grassplot before the jail in Prison Lane on a
certain summer
<301>
morning not less than two(numbers) centuries ago was
occupied by a pretty
<302>
large number of the
[inhabitants of Boston](people) all
with their eyes
<303>
intently fastened on the [iron clamped]
oaken(adjectives) door Amongst any other
<304>
population or at a later period in the history
of New England the
<305>
grim(adjectives) rigidity that petrified the bearded
physiognomies of these good
<306>
people would have augured some awful business in
hand It could have
<307>
betokened nothing short of the anticipated
execution of some noted
<308>
culprit on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal
had but confirmed
<309>
the verdict of public sentiment But in that early
severity of the
<310>
Puritan character an inference of this kind
could not so indubitably
<311>
be drawn It might be that a sluggish(adjectives)
bondservant(people)
or an undutiful(adjectives)
<312>
child whom his parents had given over to the
civil authority was to
<313>
be corrected at the [whipping post]([that hurts])
It might be
that an Antinomian a
<314>
Quaker or other heterodox religionist was to be
scourged out of the
<315>
town or an idle and vagrant Indian(people)
whom the white
mans firewater
<316>
had made riotous about the streets was to be
driven with stripes into
<317>
the shadow of the forest It might be too that
a witch like old
<318>
[Mistress Hibbins](people) the(articles)
bittertempered(adjectives) widow of the
magistrate(people) was to
<319>
die upon the gallows In either case there was
very much the same
<320>
solemnity of demeanor on the part of the
spectators as befitted a(articles)
<321>
people amongst whom religion and law were almost
identical and in
<322>
whose character both were so thoroughly(adverbs)
interfused(adjectives) that the mildest
<323>
and the severest acts of public discipline were
alike made venerable
<324>
and awful Meagre indeed and cold was the sympathy
that a
<325>
transgressor(people) might look for from
such bystanders(people)
at the scaffold On
<326>
the other hand a penalty which in our days
would
infer a degree of
<327>
mocking infamy and ridicule might then be
invested
with almost as
<328>
stern a dignity as the punishment of
death itself
<329>
It was a circumstance to be noted on the summer
morning when our
<330>
story begins its course that the women of whom
there were several in
<1000>
the crowd appeared to take a peculiar interest
in whatever penal
<1001>
infliction might be expected to ensue The age
had not so much
<1002>
refinement that any sense of impropriety
restrained the wearers of
<1002>
petticoat and farthingale([weird words])
from stepping forth
into the public ways
<1002>
and wedging their not unsubstantial persons
if occasion were into
<45>
the throng nearest to the scaffold at an
execution Morally as well
as materially there was a coarser fibre in
those wives and maidens of
old English birth and breeding than in their
fair descendants
separated from them by a series of six or seven
generations for
<1002>
throughout that chain of ancestry every
successive mother has
transmitted to her child a fainter bloom a more
delicate and briefer
beauty and a slighter physical frame if not a
character of less
force and solidity([weird words]) than her
own The women who
were now standing
about the prisondoor stood within less than
half a century of the
period when the manlike Elizabeth had been the
not altogether
unsuitable representative of the sex They were
her countrywomen and
the beef and ale of their native land with a
moral diet not a whit
more refined entered largely into their
composition The bright
<1002>
morning sun therefore shone on broad shoulders
and [well developed]
busts and on round and ruddy cheeks that had
ripened in the [far off]
<110>
island and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner
in the atmosphere of
New England There was moreover a boldness and
rotundity([weird words]) of speech
among these matrons as most of them seemed to be
that would startle
<120>
us at the present day whether in respect to its
purport or its volume
of tone
<200>
[Good wives] said a [hard featured] dame of
fifty Ill
tell ye a piece
of my mind It would be greatly for the public
behoof([weird words]) if we women
being of mature age and [church members](people)
in good repute([weird words]) should have the
handling of such malefactresses([weird words]) as
this [Hester Prynne] What think ye
<42>
gossips If the hussy stood up for judgment before
us five that are
now here in a knot together would she come off
with such a sentence
<25>
as the worshipful magistrates have awarded
Marry I trow not
<3290>
[People say] said another that
[the Reverend Master Dimmesdale] her
godly pastor takes it very grievously to heart
that such a scandal
should have come upon his congregation
<210>
The magistrates are [God fearing] gentlemen but
merciful
overmuchthat([weird words]) is a truth added a
third autumnal
matron At the
very least they should have put the brand of a
hot iron on
[Hester Prynne](people) forehead Madam Hester
would have winced at that I warrant
me But she the naughty baggage little will
she care
what they
put upon the bodice([weird words]) of her
gown Why look you she
may cover it with
a brooch or such like heathenish adornment and
so walk the streets
as brave as ever
<302>
Ah but interposed more softly a young wife
holding a child by
the hand let her cover the mark as she will
the pang of it will be
always in her heart
<100>
[Illustration: The Gossips]
<302>
What do we talk of marks and brands whether on
the bodice of her
gown or the flesh of her forehead cried another
female the ugliest
as well as the most pitiless of these
[self constituted] judges This
woman has brought shame upon us all and ought
to die Is there not
law for it Truly there is both in the Scripture
and the
[statute book] Then let the magistrates who have
made it of no effect
thank themselves if their own wives and
daughters
go astray
<1>
Mercy on us [good wife](people) exclaimed a man
in the crowd
is there no
virtue in woman save what springs from a
wholesome fear of the
gallows That is the hardest word yet Hush now
gossips for the
lock is turning in the [prison door] and here
comes
[Mistress Prynne](people)
herself
<10>
The door of the jail being flung open from within
there appeared in
the first place like a black shadow emerging into
sunshine the grim
and grisly presence of the townbeadle with a
sword by his side and
his staff of office in his hand This personage
prefigured([weird words]) and
represented in his aspect the whole dismal
severity of the Puritanic([weird words])
code of law which it was his business to
administer in its final and
closest application to the offender Stretching
forth the official
<100>
staff in his left hand he laid his right upon
the shoulder of a young
woman whom he thus drew forward until on the
threshold of the
[prison door] she repelled him by an action
marked
with natural
dignity and force of character and stepped
into
the open air as if
by her own free will She bore in her arms a child
a baby of some
three months old who winked and turned aside its
little face from the
too vivid light of day because its existence
heretofore had brought
it acquainted only with the gray twilight of
a dungeon or other
darksome([weird words]) apartment of the prison
<1000>
When the young womanthe mother of this childstood
fully revealed
before the crowd it seemed to be her first
impulse
to clasp the
infant closely to her bosom not so much by an
impulse of motherly
affection as that she might thereby conceal a
certain token which
was wrought or fastened into her dress In a
moment however wisely
judging that one token of her shame would but
poorly serve to hide
another she took the baby on her arm and with
a burning(adjectives) blush and
<2000>
yet a haughty([weird words]) smile and a
glance that would
not be abashed looked
around at her townspeople(people) and
neighbors On
the breast of her gown
in fine red cloth surrounded with an
elaborate embroidery and
fantastic flourishes of [gold thread] appeared
the letter A It was so
artistically done and with so much fertility
and gorgeous luxuriance(adjectives)
of fancy that it had all the effect of a last
and fitting decoration
to the apparel which she wore and which was of
a splendor in
accordance with the taste of the age but greatly
beyond what was
allowed by the sumptuary([weird words])
regulations of the colony
<3000>
The young woman was tall with a figure of perfect
elegance on a large
scale She had dark and abundant hair so glossy
that it threw off the
sunshine with a gleam and a face which besides
being beautiful from
regularity of feature and richness of complexion
had the
impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and
deep black eyes She was
<4000>
ladylike too after the manner of the feminine
gentility(adjectives) of those
days characterized by a certain state and dignity
rather than by the
delicate evanescent and indescribable grace
which is now recognized
as its indication And never had
[Hester Prynne](people)
appeared more
ladylike in the antique interpretation of the
term than as she
issued from the prison Those who had before
known her and had
expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by
a disastrous cloud were
<5000>
astonished and even startled to perceive how
her beauty shone out
and made a halo of the misfortune and
ignominy in which she was
enveloped It may be true that to a sensitive
observer there was
something exquisitely painful in it Her attire
which indeed she
had wrought for the occasion in prison and had
modelled much after
her own fancy seemed to express the attitude of
her spirit the
desperate recklessness of her mood by its wild
and picturesque([weird words])
<6000>
peculiarity But the point which drew all eyes
and as it were
transfigured the wearer so that both men and
women who had been
familiarly acquainted with [Hester Prynne](people)
were now impressed as if
they beheld her for the first time was that
[SCARLET LETTER] so
fantastically embroidered and illuminated
upon her bosom It had the
<7000>
effect of a spell taking her out of the
ordinary relations with
humanity and enclosing her in a sphere by
herself
<8000>
She hath good skill at her needle that is
certain remarked one of
her female spectators but did ever a
woman before this brazen
hussy contrive such a way of showing it
Why gossips what is it but
to laugh in the faces of our godly
magistrates and make a pride out
of what they worthy gentlemen meant
for a punishment
<9000>
It were well muttered the most
ironvisaged([weird words]) of the old dames if
we stripped [Madam Hesters](people)
rich gown off her
dainty shoulders and as
for the red letter which she hath stitched so
curiously Ill bestow
a rag of mine own rheumatic([weird words])
flannel to make a
fitter one
<10000>
O peace neighbors peace whispered their
youngest companion do
not let her hear you Not a stitch in that
embroidered letter but she
has felt it in her heart
<11000>
The grim beadle now made a gesture with
his staff
<12000>
Make way good people make way in the Kings
name cried he Open
a passage and I promise ye
[Mistress Prynne](people) shall be set where man
woman and child may have a fair sight of her
brave apparel from this
time till an hour past meridian A blessing on
the righteous Colony of
the Massachusetts where iniquity is dragged out
into the sunshine
Come along Madam Hester and show your
scarlet letter in the
marketplace
<13000>
A lane was forthwith opened through the
crowd of spectators Preceded
by the beadle and attended by an
irregular procession of
[stern browed](adjectives) men and
unkindly visaged women [Hester Prynne](people)
set forth
towards the place appointed for her
punishment A crowd of eager and
curious schoolboys understanding little
of the matter in hand
except that it gave them a [half holiday]
ran before her progress
turning their heads continually to stare
into her face and at the
<1>
winking baby in her arms and at the
ignominious letter on her breast
It was no great distance in those days
from the [prison door] to the
marketplace Measured by the prisoners
experience however it might
be reckoned a journey of some length for
haughty as her demeanor
was she perchance underwent an agony from
every footstep of those
<2>
that thronged to see her as if her heart had
been flung into the
street for them all to spurn and trample upon
In our nature however
there is a provision alike marvellous and
merciful that the sufferer
should never know the intensity of what he
endures by its present
<10>
torture but chiefly by the pang that rankles
after it With almost a
serene deportment therefore
[Hester Prynne](people)
passed through this
portion of her ordeal and came to a sort of
scaffold at the western
extremity of the marketplace It stood nearly
beneath the eaves of
Bostons earliest church and appeared to be a
fixture there
<45>
In fact this scaffold constituted a portion of
a penal machine which
now for two or three generations past has been
merely historical and
traditionary among us but was held in the old
time to be as
effectual an agent in the promotion of good
citizenship as ever was
the guillotine among the terrorists of France
It was in short the
platform of the pillory and above it rose the
framework of that
instrument of discipline so fashioned as to
confine the human head in
<300>
its tight grasp and thus hold it up to the
public gaze The very
ideal of ignominy was embodied and made
manifest in this contrivance
of wood and iron There can be no outrage
methinks against our
common nature whatever be the
delinquencies([weird words])
of the individual no
outrage more flagrant than to forbid the
culprit to hide his face for
shame as it was the essence of this
punishment to do In [Hester Prynne](people)
instance however as not unfrequently
in other cases her
<120439>
sentence bore that she should stand a certain
time upon the platform
but without undergoing that gripe about the
neck and confinement of
the head the proneness to which was the most
devilish characteristic
of this ugly engine Knowing well her part
she ascended a flight of
wooden steps and was thus displayed to the
surrounding multitude at
about the height of a mans shoulders above
the street
<4982>
Had there been a Papist among the crowd of
Puritans he might have
seen in this beautiful woman so picturesque
in her attire and mien
and with the infant at her bosom an object to
remind him of the image
of Divine Maternity which so many illustrious
painters have vied with
one another to represent something which
should remind him indeed
but only by contrast of that sacred
image of sinless motherhood
whose infant was to redeem the world
Here there was the taint of
deepest sin in the most sacred quality
of human life working such
effect that the world was only the darker
for this womans beauty
and the more lost for the infant that she
had borne
<429>
The scene was not without a mixture of
awe such as must always invest
the spectacle of guilt and shame in a
fellow creature before society
shall have grown corrupt enough to smile
instead of shuddering at
it The witnesses of [Hester Prynne] disgrace
had not yet passed
beyond their simplicity They were stern enough
to look upon her
death had that been the sentence without a
murmur at its severity
<45>
but had none of the heartlessness of another
social state which would
find only a theme for jest in an exhibition
like the present Even had
there been a disposition to turn the matter
into ridicule it must
have been repressed and overpowered by the
solemn presence of men no
less dignified than the Governor and several
of his counsellors a
judge a general and the ministers of the town
all of whom sat or
<43>
stood in a balcony of the meetinghouse
looking down upon the
platform When such personages could
constitute a part of the
spectacle without risking the majesty or
reverence of rank and
office it was safely to be inferred that
the infliction of a legal
sentence would have an earnest and effectual
meaning Accordingly the
crowd was sombre and grave The unhappy culprit
sustained herself as
best a woman might under the heavy weight of
a thousand unrelenting
<43>
eyes all fastened upon her and concentrated
at her bosom It was
almost intolerable to be borne Of an impulsive
and passionate nature
she had fortified herself to encounter the stings
and venomous stabs
of public contumely wreaking itself in every
variety of insult but
there was a quality so much more terrible
in the solemn mood of the
popular mind that she longed rather to
behold all those rigid
countenances contorted with scornful
merriment and herself the
object Had a roar of laughter burst
from the multitude each man
each woman each little
[shrill voiced](adjectives)
child contributing their
<22>
individual parts [Hester Prynne] might
have repaid them all with a
bitter and disdainful smile But under
the leaden infliction which it
was her doom to endure she felt at
moments as if she must needs
shriek out with the full power of her
lungs and cast herself from the
scaffold down upon the ground or else
go mad at once
<23>
Yet there were intervals when the
whole scene in which she was the
most conspicuous object seemed to vanish from
her eyes or at least
glimmered indistinctly before them like a mass
of imperfectly shaped
and spectral images Her mind and especially
her memory was
preternaturally active and kept bringing up
other scenes than this
roughly hewn([weird words]) street of a
little town on the
edge of the Western
wilderness other faces than were lowering
upon her from beneath the
<24>
brims of those [steeple crowned] hats
Reminiscences the most trifling
and immaterial passages of infancy and
schooldays sports childish
quarrels and the little domestic traits of
her maiden years came
swarming back upon her intermingled with
recollections of whatever
was gravest in her subsequent life one picture
precisely as vivid as
<25>
another as if all were of similar importance
or all alike a play
Possibly it was an instinctive device of her
spirit to relieve
itself by the exhibition of these
phantasmagoric([weird words]) forms from the
cruel weight and hardness of the reality
<26>
Be that as it might the scaffold of the
pillory was a point of view
that revealed to [Hester Prynne] the entire
track along which she had
been treading since her happy infancy Standing
on that miserable
<27>
eminence she saw again her native village in
Old England and her
paternal home a decayed house of gray stone
with a [poverty stricken]
aspect but retaining a
[half obliterated](adjectives) shield
of arms over the
portal in token of antique gentility She saw
her fathers face with
its bald brow and reverend white beard that
flowed over the
[old fashioned] Elizabethan ruff her mothers too
with the look of
heedful and anxious love which it always wore
in her remembrance and
<28>
which even since her death had so often laid
the impediment of a
gentle remonstrance in her daughters pathway
She saw her own
face glowing with girlish beauty and
illuminating all the interior
of the dusky mirror in which she had been
wont to gaze at it There
she beheld another countenance of a man
well stricken in years a
pale thin [scholar like] visage with eyes dim
and bleared([weird words]) by the
lamplight that had served them to pore over
many ponderous books Yet
<29>
those same bleared optics had a strange
penetrating power when it
was their owners purpose to read the human
soul This figure of the
study and the cloister as [Hester Prynne]
womanly fancy failed not to
recall was slightly deformed with the left
shoulder a trifle higher
than the right Next rose before her in memory
[picture gallery] the
intricate and narrow thoroughfares the tall
gray houses the huge
cathedrals and the public edifices ancient
in date and quaint in
<30>
architecture of a Continental city where a
new life had awaited her
still in connection with the misshapen scholar
a new life but
feeding itself on timeworn materials like a tuft
of green moss on a
crumbling wall Lastly in lieu of these shifting
scenes came back
the rude marketplace of the Puritan settlement
with all the
<31>
townspeople assembled and levelling their stern
regards at [Hester Prynne] eyes at herself who stood on the scaffold
of the pillory
an infant on her arm and [the letter A] in
scarlet fantastically
embroidered with [gold thread] upon her bosom
